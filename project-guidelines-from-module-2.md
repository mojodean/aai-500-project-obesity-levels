### Introduction

The final project for this course will assess the development of an end-to-end statistical analysis. By the end of Module 2, you will be assigned to a group by your instructor. You and your teammate(s) will work closely to find a dataset, clean and prepare it for analysis, perform EDA, and produce a model. You will then create a final technical report discussing the results of your analysis and the validity of your model. It is required that you and your team use GitHub as a code hosting platform to manage version control and collaboration during this project. It is also necessary to create and add a README file to your GitHub repository. It is recommended that you follow the PEP 8Links to an external site. â€“ Style Guide for your Python code in the final project.

### Project Timeline
 
    - Module 2 (by the end of Week 2): The course instructor will group students into teams of two to three members.
    
    - Module 4 (by the end of Week 4): Each team will select and introduce a dataset. The team representative will submit the "Team Project Status Update Form."
    
    - Module 7 (by the end of Week 7): Each team will submit the following deliverables for the course project in the final week:
   
        - Technical Report: One PDF document with your final technical report. This should describe your preparation and analysis of the data, discuss the final model selection, and describe the statistics behind your final model selection.
        - Team Presentation: One 8-10 minute video presentation by all team members. Do not exceed 10 minutes. Submit one mp4 file. This should be presented as a business presentation of your analysis to a non-technical audience. You will present your analysis and findings in a way that is understandable to any non-technical executive or business leader. This presentation should include one slide to showcase your collaborative efforts; you will create a presentation slide highlighting each team member's individual names and their contributions to the final project work and deliverables.

**It is critical to note that no extensions will be given for any of the final projects' due dates for any reason, and final projects submitted after the final due date will not be graded.

### Project Datasets

You are responsible for finding a dataset for the final team project in this course. Several free data resources are provided by the UCI Machine Learning RepositoryLinks to an external site..

### Requirements

    - Divide the work equally between the team members for the following steps, and everyone needs to code and review the code.

For your technical report document:

    - You should include the following sections in your report:
    
        - Introduction
        - Data Cleaning/Preparation
        - Exploratory Data Analysis
        - Model Selection
        - Model Analysis
        - Conclusion and Recommendations.
    - Include an appendix with the output of your code from a technical notebook (i.e., Jupyter Notebook).

For your video presentation:

    - Give an 8-10 minute presentation of your analysis aimed at a non-technical audience of business leaders.
    - Each team member should participate in the presentation equally.

### Project Deliverables and Submission Format

    - Prepare and submit your Final Technical Report in PDF format on Canvas. You will use the naming convention Final-Project-Report-Team-Number.pdf (e.g., Final-Project-Report-Team-1.pdf)
    - Prepare a recorded video presentation of your project using a screencasting tool, such as Screencast-O-Matic or Zoom, to record your screen and provide a voice narration.
        
        - Ensure that the sound quality of your video is good and each member presents an equal portion of the presentation.
        - Export the video file to an mp4 format.
        - You may use any recording software you wish. View Recording Video Presentation and Submission Guidelines for AAI students. 
        - You will use the naming convention Final-Project-Presentation-Team-Number.mp4 (e.g., Final-Project-Presentation-Team-1.mp4).
    
    - Only ONE member of your team will need to submit these deliverables.
    - You will submit the peer evaluation form individually in Assignment 7.1.

### Groupwork Requirements

The final teamwork project is an essential component of our courses in the AAI program. This project is representative of the kind of collaborative project you may work on during your career and real-world projects. A significant portion of your final grade is drawn from your participation in this final group project, so you are strongly encouraged to work within your team and that each team member contributes equally to the final project deliverables. Team members should plan to have clear and ongoing communication with your team and engage with the project and its deliverables each week. Lack of participation and engagement with both your team and your final project can result in a failing grade for the course.

While these are the expectations for the project work, if you do experience difficulty with project advancement or challenges with team dynamics, contact your instructor for assistance promptly. If you are unable to perform the project as a team, contact your instructor to explore pursuing the entire final project independently.

To understand how your work will be assessed, view the assignment rubric on the Final Team Project page.
