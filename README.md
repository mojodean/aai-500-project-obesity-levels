## Project Description

This project was done as a graduate-course-level exercise in analysizing a public dataset for machine learning. We evaluated and cleansed the dataset, threw our methods against it, and drew conclusions in a technical paper that was submitted alongside this jupyter notebook.

For this project, you can download the Jupyter notebook to review our code and analysis, and you may certainly submit issues or PRs if you have additional considerations or find any errors. While this is not an active project, its an example of a collaboration we did early on in our machine learning journey.
